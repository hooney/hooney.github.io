I"H<p><a href="http://www.esanity.co.uk/podcasts/HandsToBoag.mp3">CSS에 대한 Love Song</a>을 발견했습니다(via <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Simplebit</a>). 전세계 수많은 웹디자이너들의 CSS에 대한 애찬이 노래로 나올줄은 물랐네요~ ㅎㅎ</p>

<p>노래 가사가 정말 재밌습니다. 창 밖에 내리는 빗방울에 가슴 한구석의 응어리가 쓸려나가는 기분이네요.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The supervisor rants. He says “This website’s pants! I want my clicks improved by Friday!”<br />
I hit the URL. It’s like the bowels of hell. God give me strength. It’s just not my day.<br />
So raise your hands to Boag and pray that we can fix this website today.<br />
Tonight I need your CSS, coding in the darkness. From now on no more tables nest; you will meet web standards.<br />
The source code makes me weep. There’s tables fifteen-deep. In Netscape 6 it looks like garbage.<br />
The METAs say this turd was made with MS Word. With every click I find new carnage.<br />
So raise your hands to Boag and pray that we can fix this website today.<br />
Tonight I need your CSS, coding in the darkness. From now on no more tables nest; you will meet web standards.<br />
I guess I’ll have to start from scratch – then I can kiss this piece of trash goodbye…</p>
