W3C WAI가 만들고 있는 [웹 콘텐츠 접근성 지침(Web Content Accessibility Guidelines: WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/)이 [어제 날자로 완성](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-wai-ig/2008OctDec/0091.html)됐습니다. 올해 12월까지 W3C 승인 절차만 통과하면 공고(Recommendation)되겠네요.

> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 was published as a W3C Proposed Recommendation on 3 November 2008. This means that the technical material of WCAG 2.0 is complete and it has been implemented in real sites. The next stage is the final publication, which is expected in December 2008

Proposed Recommendation는 W3C가 기술 명세서()를 작성하고 공고하는 [과정](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process)에 따르면 다음과 같습니다.

> Proposed Recommendation: After there are implementations of each feature of the technical report, W3C announces it as a Proposed Recommendation. At this stage, the report is submitted to the W3C Membership for endorsement.

몇 주 전부터 WCAG 2.0 문서를 번역중인데, 속도를 더 내야겠습니다. 🙂
