[CSS에 대한 Love Song](http://www.esanity.co.uk/podcasts/HandsToBoag.mp3)을 발견했습니다(via [Simplebit](http://www.simplebits.com/)). 전세계 수많은 웹디자이너들의 CSS에 대한 애찬이 노래로 나올줄은 물랐네요~ ㅎㅎ

노래 가사가 정말 재밌습니다. 창 밖에 내리는 빗방울에 가슴 한구석의 응어리가 쓸려나가는 기분이네요.

> The supervisor rants. He says &#8220;This website&#8217;s pants! I want my clicks improved by Friday!&#8221;  
> I hit the URL. It&#8217;s like the bowels of hell. God give me strength. It&#8217;s just not my day.  
> So raise your hands to Boag and pray that we can fix this website today.  
> Tonight I need your CSS, coding in the darkness. From now on no more tables nest; you will meet web standards.  
> The source code makes me weep. There&#8217;s tables fifteen-deep. In Netscape 6 it looks like garbage.  
> The METAs say this turd was made with MS Word. With every click I find new carnage.  
> So raise your hands to Boag and pray that we can fix this website today.  
> Tonight I need your CSS, coding in the darkness. From now on no more tables nest; you will meet web standards.  
> I guess I&#8217;ll have to start from scratch &#8211; then I can kiss this piece of trash goodbye&#8230;
